                  Files for OpenMM-Enabled Tinker Executables
                  ###########################################

       This directory contains the files needed to build Tinker versions
       of the ANALYZE, BAR and DYNAMIC programs using the GPU-capable
       OpenMM libraries. The files in this directory should be copied
       into the /source directory of a clean distribution of Tinker, and
       the programs can be compiled and linked in that modified /source
       directory.

       Building OpenMM-enabled executables requires a special version of
       OpenMM, called Tinker-OpenMM, and available via a separate GitHub
       branch, currently https://github.com/TinkerTools/Tinker-OpenMM.
       This version has changes from the canonical Stanford OpenMM that
       are needed for the Tinker interface, beyond implementation of the
       AMOEBA force field.

       The provided Makefile can be used, after minor edits, to build
       GPU-enabled executables. Either the GNU compilers or the Intel
       compilers can be used. The Makefile assumes OpenMM is found in
       its default location, /usr/local/openmm. NVIDIA CUDA V9 or later
       must be installed on the target machine, as well as a CUDA-capable
       graphics card.
